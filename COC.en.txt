Grazer Linuxtage - Code of Conduct
==================================

1. You are welcome.

In order to make the Graz Linuxtage fun, interesting and positive for everyone
involved, we want to create an open, cooperative, educational atmosphere.
Learning and exchange with others is our priority.

Therefore, the following guidelines/rules of conduct apply without exception
for everyone participating at Grazer Linuxtage.

2. We are respectful to each other and show consideration for others.

We are helpful, considerate, friendly and treat each other with respect. We
accept that there are different perspectives and needs and embrace feedback as
an opportunity to learn. This also includes online, event-related interaction.

3. Harassment, bullying or discrimination is unacceptable and we welcome tips.

What is unacceptable behavior is determined by the individual involved.
Consequences will be determined by the organizer.

In the event of an incident report either to the nearest angel or via email
(anonymously if you want: hilfe@linuxtage.at).
Angels can be recognized by orange  T-shirts and lanyards with their
name and the Linuxtage logo. The sooner we hear  about it, the sooner
we can react. If you observe unacceptable behavior then support
the person concerned.

4. Grazer Linuxtage reserves the right to exclude persons.

Grazer Linuxtage has domiciliary right. We will use this right if persons
violate these guidelines. However, we also want to give such a person people
the opportunity to understand why and how we could make the situation
constructive. Depending on the situation, consequences will be decided by us
and may be temporary or valid for future events.

5. Thank you for helping to make Graz Linuxtage an enjoyable experience for all participants.

In order to foster a welcoming and open community, we are committed to good
behavior by all who attend GLT. Thank you for your help in making Graz Linuxtage
a successful and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
